This is a c based chatting program made for me and aruuuu..

Whenever we will run this program at start it will ask us to enter a string , this step will basically act as our chat lock,
If we press 007 ---> We get logged in as aruu and we will send msgs to bhaviii      &&&&&
If we press 016 ---> we get logged in as me and we can read and send msgs to aruuu now     &&&&&
If we press any other thing any other string ---> It will get checked for palindrome or not and will be print as palindrome or not and program will end.

If we've logged in to 007 or 016 , live chat mode will be enabled where whatever we type will be sent and whetever we receive will be on a new line with starting as "R:" representing a received msg..

Ik aruu , im soooo genius ðŸ˜˜(Only by God's grace)
